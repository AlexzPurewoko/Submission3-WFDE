## Code

Use TypeScript as a main language to develop website, javascript to configure the webpack, SASS to configure the main styling of application, CSS for other styling (material-icons), and HTML5 for template.

## Test Scope

**Unit Test :** All Base Class (application, activity, fragment, fragment adapter) and API code for logic testing

**End to End Test :** All Scope Test


## How To Run (Locally)

Type command **npm run build** to build the ressources and **npm run start** to start the NodeJS Server. Please don't use another locale runner server, because we use **brotli** compression mechanisms to handle javascript compression (due to reduce the size of load file). So if you use another server, there will be a performance degradation, because not implementing **Accept-Encoding** & **Content-Encoding** headers.

## How To Run (Test)

There are 2 test to be run : 

#### Unit Test

Type command **npm run test** to start karma jasmine test. The total of test is approximately 45 case, which will be end in about 2 seconds.

#### End To End Testing

Firstly, type **npm run dev-debug** to start live server for serving assets for codeceptjs. Switch to another tabs, please don't close and type **npm run e2eTest** to start end to end testing. Total of test is approximately 23 case, which will be end in about 3m 40s.
